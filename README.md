# Comparative-Study-Image-Classification-Mask-Detection-Dataset
Implemented a comparative study on different network architectures for a classification task. The goal is to build a deep neural network model that can divide individuals into three groups: "With mask," "Without mask," and "Mask worn incorrectly."
